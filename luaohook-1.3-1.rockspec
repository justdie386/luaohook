    detailed  = [[
        This library requires luajit to be installed. This is a cross platform library that allows you to make hotkeys, interact with the mouse and keyboard, but globaly, not just when focusing a certain window, works on X11, windows and macos. Thanks to the libuiohook project which i built this library around. The keys are mapped here: https://github.com/kwhat/libuiohook/blob/1.2/include/uiohook.h#L134-L403. if luarocks failed to build the library on your platform, please open an issue so that i could look into it here https://github.com/justdie386/luaohook/issues
